                <p id="opening">Many believers agree that through prayers,many problems get solved.That whenever you pray God listens and answers your prayers.But the reality is believing in prayers is a pure superstition.Prayers have never fixed anything.How do we know that prayers don’t work?Well, we analyze what Jesus said in the Bible.We’ll also cite other examples out of the Bible.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Imagine you are a believer,you have faith in God and you’re sure God always answers your prayers.You kneel down and say this simple prayer.
                <b>“Dear God, almighty, all-powerful, all-loving creator of the universe, I pray to you to cure every case of cancer on this planet tonight. I pray in faith, knowing you will bless me as you describe in <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Matthew 17:20</a>, <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 21:21</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Mark 11:24</a>, <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John 14:12-14</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Matthew 18:19</a>and <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">James 5:15-16</a>. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen."</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>This is a simple,non materialistic,unselfish prayer that you pray knowing that when it gets answered,it will help millions of people in remarkable ways.In fact it will turn most skeptics into believers.Now what do you think it’s going to happen.Is cancer going to be cured by tomorrow?Of course not.</p>
                <p>When we analyze Jesus statements in the Bible,he promises a dozens of possibilities.Let's look at the following verses from the Bible.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>Jesus says:
                <b> “Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 17:20</a>Jesus says:<b></b>“For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.”</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 21:21:</a><b>“I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Mark 11:24:</a><b>“Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John chapter14:12-14 </a>Jesus tells us just how easy prayer can be:<b>"I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">James 5:15-16</a>the Bible says:<b>“And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Having read what Jesus said in the Bible,does He fulfill what  he promises?Jesus says nothing will be impossible to us through prayers.He says that anyone who asks in his name shall receive.But why is it that we have so many impossibilities?Why is it that if we pray for cancer to get cured nothing happens?Or does Jesus give a boundary on what we should pray about?.Why is it that sick people who get prayed to die?Why is it that innocent children starve to death in many places in the world.All these impossibilities contradict what Jesus says and what he’s supposed to be.</p>  
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 18:19</a>Jesus says:<b>“Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” </b></p>
                <p>Do you think that cancer will be cured,if we gather a million believers and ask them to pray in the name of Jesus?No,of course no.Nothing will happen.This contradicts what Jesus said in the Bible.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Psalms 139:16</a>The Bible says;<b>“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>If God knows what will happen in your life time then why bother to pray in the first place?You don’t have free will. Nothing is going to change God's plan about you.Why should you pray for cancer when God knew it’s the same disease that is going to kill you.Jesus promising to fulfill what we pray for and he doesn’t,means he is a lier.</p>
                <p>If you are an intelligent person,you should have noticed something from this contradictions
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Jesus is a liar.</li>
                    <li>2. Jesus never knew what he was talking about.</li>
                    <li>3. God does exist, but he never answers prayers. Unfortunately, God is defined by the Bible to be a prayer-answering being. The contradiction between the reality of God and the definition of God proves that God is imaginary.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We can draw other examples from our history.A scientific experiment was done in an attempt to discover whether prayers had any effect. <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Visit the article here</a>
                In this study,researchers found that having people pray for heart bypass surgery patients had no effect on their recovery. In fact, patients who knew they were being prayed for had a slightly higher rate of complications.Even theologians and religious leaders agreed on the same as seen in this <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">article</a></p>
                <p>Despite all this tangible evidence alot of believers come up with rationalizations to defend their beliefs.You may hear some of them say that God is not tested through scientific experiments.Or God must remain hidden.
                If God must remain hidden then he must not answer prayers because he will be exposed.Also from the Bible God is not hidden.
                Also when Jesus makes direct statements like “nothing will be impossible” and doesn’t mean what he says.It just proves how imaginary he is.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another section of believers may say that prayers are answered in the form of “YES,NO,WAIT ''.This is not the truth because,No matter what you pray to the answer is always “YES,NO,WAIT.
                Whether it’s God,The sun or any other thing.
                To know that the answer is always Yes,No and Wait no matter who you pray to,let’s examine this example.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would like you to do this simple experiment.Take out your phone and ask it to give you five thousand shillings at the end of the week.Since you are a believer and you trust in Jesus,ask the same.Now wait till the end of the week.If you are an intelligent observer,you’ll realize that both prayers get answered at the same rate.When the two weeks end you may or you may not get the five thousand shillings in both scenarios.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another simple example.Lets say your a group of 30 people on a road trip.All of you have read the Bible in <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Luke 1:37</a>.Then an accident occurs.All your colleagues die except you.When reporters come to interview you,we here you say something like “Am very lucky,if it was not God, I wouldn’t be here I would be dead.I prayed to him and he answered my prayers”.
                Take a moment and ask yourself how special are you that God decided to answer your prayers and assumed the rest of your colleagues?What do you think the families of the deceased would think about your God when they hear you make such statements?Selfish right? The conclusion is,your prayers were never answered.And if you thank God that you didn’t die but the rest of your colleagues died,God is to be blamed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also;
                When you pray, work hard and pass exams and thank God,God is to be blamed for your colleague who prayed, worked hard and failed.
                When you pray for food that is on your dining table.God is to be blamed for those innocent children who are starving in the rest of the world.
                When you rejoice that God has answered your prayers by healing you.Then God is to be blamed for that person who prayed and died due to sickness.etc</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our Kenyan National anthem is like a prayer.It’s recited in schools every week.Our religious leader holds prayer meetings to pray for our nation.But at the end nothing changes.Poverty is still a thing.Hunger is still there.Corruption is never ending.Fornication is the language and rape is still there.Terrorism is still there.Accidents etc</p>
                <p>Recently,many people lost lives through accidents at a place known as Salgaa.A prayer was done to protect more deaths.But it didn't fix anything.Its the engineers who solved the problem.Its a scientific method that worked.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s time to realize that prayers have zero effect on our lives.Each and every answered prayer is just a coincidence.
                <ul>
                    <li>* No matter what you pray for.No matter who is praying,</li>
                    <li>* No matter which God you’re praying to</li>
                    <li>* Don't deny yourself food  because you’re fasting.nothing is going to change.Just look for some other means to solve those problems.</li>
                    <li>* Don't deny your family medication,prayers never heal.Its the medicine that heals you.</li>
                    <li>* Don't rebuke people when they don't pray before they eat,it's their effort that made it possible to put that food on the table.</li>
                </ul>
