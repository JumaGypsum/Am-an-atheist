                <p id="opening"> According to the dictionary,God is defined as A being conceived to be perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe.Think of how the world would look if there was such a being! Is it possible for such a being to exist in the first place?let's exermine.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Someone by the name Epicures thought forum it and came up with this interesting idea.
                He said <b>“The gods can either take away evil from the world and will not, or, being willing to do so, cannot; or they neither can nor will, or lastly, they are both able and willing. If they have the will to remove evil and cannot, then they are not omnipotent. If they can, but will not, then they are not benevolent. If they are neither able nor willing, then they are neither omnipotent nor benevolent. Lastly, if they are both able and willing to annihilate evil, how does it exist?"</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Thinking about one of things this guy said.God has the power to remove evil in the society,but evil still exists,meaning he is not all caring.This contradicts his nature.It also puts limits to his powers too.</p>
                <p>Onother way of aproaching the same idea is toput God's powers to test.We ask this question,"Can God create a stone larger and so heavy that he cant lift?If the answer is Yes then God's power is limited.Still if the answer is No his powers are still limited.This contradicts his nature.Therfore he cant exist.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another example comes from the Bible in the book of <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7.</a>Jesus says;
                <b> "Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”</b></p>
                <p> Now think about what Jesus said as an intelligent person.Does this promise get fulfilled in our daily lives?Assume you’re a child.You pray to God for food since you’re almost starving to death.What would you expect to happen according to Jesus's statement?Your expectations are,an all loving,all caring God to get the food delivered to you.In fact a child doesn’t have to pray.A good caring parent knows when his child needs food.
                But strangely we find that millions of people are dying of starvation every year.And that tells us how non existing God is.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another impossibility comes from the fact that God is omniscient.This means that God knows all that will happen in your life until you die.Ask yourself,do you have a free will in such a world?Of course not.
                <a href="" class="" target="_blank">Psalm 139:16</a> The Bible says,<b> "You saw me before I was born and scheduled each day of my life before I began to breathe. Every day was recorded in your book!"</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>          
                This verse Invalidates who God is in a great way.Let's look at history.We all know that  Hitler was very evil.He killed millions of people in the holocaust.Now think about it.God created Hitler knowing very well that he will end up murdering millions of people.That sounds crazy right?
                Also God knows whether you will go to heaven or hell.Creating someone knowing he will end up in hell is so evil.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another way to approach this is to look at how God is defined.He is the ruler and originator of the universe.Why does the universe need an originator/creator? Because, according to religious logic, the universe cannot exist unless it has a creator. A believer will say, "nothing can exist unless it is created." However, that statement immediately constructs a contradiction, because we must then wonder who created God. For a believer the answer to that is simple."God is the one thing that does not need a creator. God is timeless and has always existed." How can it be that everything MUST have a creator, while God must Not?The contradiction should be suggesting something.</p>
                <br>
                <p>  As soon as you think about the concept of a perfect, omnipotent, omniscient being, you realize the impossibility of the concept. That impossibility is yet another way to see that God is imaginary.</p>
