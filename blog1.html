            <h2>Everyone is ignoring jesus</h2>
            <img src="../img/ignore.jpg">
            <p>Many believers consider reading the Bible,being born again and putting faith in action a direct ticket to heaven. Most of beleieve that the Bible is literally true.But,they don’t rsealize that they are completely ignoring Jesus' core message.
            </p>    
            <p>This article is going to prove to you that everyone is ignoring Jesus' core message.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>PART I</h2>
            <p>In the Bible, Jesus made a number of clear statements.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NKJV"class = "verse" >1.Mathew 6:19-21.</a> The Bible says
               <b>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</b> 
            </p>
           
            <p>Jesus teaches us not to make riches here on earth. But what a contradiction we find in real life?Count how many pastors own personal Jets and expensive SUVs.Count how many politicians are wealthy and they still believe in Jesus Christ.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14&version=NKJV" class="verse" >2.Lule 14:33</a>The Bible says; 
            <b>Any of you who does not give up everything cannot be my disciple.</b>
            </p>
          
            <p>The message is clear.You should give up on EVERYTHING.Hate everyone and everything you love.Hate yourself too.Now look at reality and ask yourself how many people have done that!
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A24&version=NKJV" class="verse" >3.Matthew 6:24</a>The Bible says; 
            <b>No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Money.</b>
           </p>
            <p>Jesus is so explicit here.No love for money.But look at our churches today.The offering is in terms of money.Every politician is after money.We are working because of money.Partners are cheating on each other because of money.Prostitution is a money oriented industry.Money runs the world.</p>

            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A21-24&version=NKJV" class="verse" >4.Matthew 19:21-24</a>
            <b>Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</b>
            </p> 
            <p> Jesus wants you to sell everything and give to the poor.Your House,your clothes,your Tv,your car….. I mean everything.The reality is,no one has ever done that.</p>

            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A28-29&version=NKJV" class="verse">5.Matthew 19:28-29</a>
            <b>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</b>
           </p>
           <p>Here,Jesus wants you to abandon your family and friends for his sake.In reality no one has ever or is going to do this.Also this is a bad moral teaching.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A23-25&version=NKJV" class="verse">6.Luke 9:23-25</a>
            <b>Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</b>
           </p>
            <p>The message is clear,deny yourself everything and follow him.Jesus means,you take all your problems to him.But the reality is,humans are the one solving their own problems.Jesus has no hand in this.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+13%3A+22&version=NKJV"class = "verse">7.Matt 13: 22</a>
            <b>The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</b>
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=NKJV" class="verse">Hebrews 13:5</a>
            <b>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."</b></p>

            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A3&version=NKJV" class="verse">8.Phil 2:3</a>
            <b>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.</b></p>
            <p> In the above verses Jesus’s core message is,”Don't love money and wealth and Give up on everything”'.But when we look at the reality we find that everyone loves money,everyone is struggling to be wealthy.Every parent is happy when his children get rich.The school system is teaching us how to be rich.Nobody can ever abandon his family and friends for the sake of Jesus.The reality is everyone is ignoring Jesus.But why should this be the case?Is it that believers don’t read the Bible?Off course they do and they know about this.Therefore as an intelligent person,three things should be clear;
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>1.Jesus didn’t know what he was talking about</li>
                    <li>2.Jesus was lying</li>
                    <li>3.Gospels are mere fiction and God is imaginary</li>
                </ol>
           </p>

           <br>
            <h2>PART II</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A18+&version=NKJV" class="verse"></a> Matthew 5:18 the Bible says;
                <b>For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</b></p>

            <p>Jesus is very clear here,All the laws in the Old Testament still applies.And Remember Jesus is God.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+35%3A2&version=NKJV" class="verse">Exodus 35:2</a>
             <b>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of Sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death.</b></p>
             <p> God lays down clear instructions.Nobody should work on the sabbath day,failure to which he/she shall  be killed.But looking at the reality.All supermarkets have people working on sabbath.Recreational sector have people working on sabbath.Power plants,airlines,hospitals and emergency services all have people working on sabbath.Why are we not killing all those millions of people as God demands?</p>
             <br>
             <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut+21%3A18-21&version=NKJV" class="verse">Deut 21:18-21.</a>says:
                <b>If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town,this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid.</b></p>
            <p>Putting that verse in perspective,count all the Youths that are stubborn and drunkard.God demands we stone millions of youths.But why are we not putting this law into practice?
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p><a href="Leviticus 20:10" class="verse">Leviticus 20:10</a>
             <b>“‘If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.</b></p>
             <p> God is very clear that we are supposed to kill each and everyone who fornicate.Am pretty sure almost everyone will get killed because fornication is the most practiced sin.But the reality is we don’t kill people who fornicate.Why?
            </p>
            <p>There are many other verses in the Bible that demands we stone millions of people including gays and lesbians.Remember also those laws to do with the clean and the unclean animals.God sets some rules on which animal to eat and not.But contrary hits you when you visit Hotels in towns.For example Poke that is forbidden is being eaten by millions of people.
            </p>
            <p>As an intelligent person,when you put the above verses into perspective,you should come to a conclusion that;
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>1.Considering the fact that no one practices what Jesus demands proof that God is imaginary.</li>
                <li>2.Whoever wrote the Bible didn’t know that morality is fluid.It changes over time.Thats why we don’t practice all those laws given in the Bible.
               Laws should make sense, which is not the case with the laws from the bible.This contradiction leads to one thing,the Bible is just a book of myth.</li>
            </ol>
