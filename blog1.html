                <p id="opening">Without a doubt, beliefs like reading the Bible, being born again, and having faith are crucial to many Christians. However, Jesus taught his followers to love their neighbors as themselves, to forgive those who wronged them, and to aid the less fortunate. Some Christians may be more focused on dogmatic beliefs and rituals than on embodying Jesus' teachings.</p>
                <p>It's essential to keep in mind that the Bible is a complex and diverse text that may be interpreted differently by different people. Some believers may read the Bible literally, while others may see it as more metaphorical or allegorical.this article we are going to see some ways in which believers are ignoring Jesus’s core message.</p>     
                <h3>PART I</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NKJV"class = "verse" target="_blank">1.Mathew 6:19-21.</a> The Bible says;
                <b>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."</b> 
                </p>
                <p>Jesus teaches his followers not to accumulate wealth and material possessions. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on spiritual riches and serving others rather than pursuing worldly possessions. However, we find that many examples of church leaders, politicians, and other people who claim to follow Jesus are living a luxury lifestyle.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">2.Luke 14:33</a> The Bible says; 
                <b>"Any of you who does not give up everything cannot be my disciple."</b></p>
                <p>The message is clear. You should give up on everything like your possessions, family, friends. In reality no one has done that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A24&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">3.Matthew 6:24</a> The Bible says; 
                <b>"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Money."</b></p>
                <p>Jesus is so explicit here. No love for money. But look at the churches today, everything is about money. The world economy is all about money.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A21-24&version=NKJV" class="verse"  target="_blank">4.Matthew 19:21-24</a> 
                Jesus answered, <b>"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</b>
                </p> 
                <p> Jesus wants you to sell everything and give it to the poor.Literaly everything you own.The reality is no one is yet to do that. Also realize that if you sell everything and give it to the poor, the poor person will own material possessions which Jesus is against. Meaning the poor person will have to sell the same possessions if he wnat to follow Jesus. So the cycle continues.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A28-29&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">5.Matthew 19:28-29</a>

                <b>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</b></p>
                <p> Jesus wants you to abandon your family and friends for his sake.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A23-25&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">6.Luke 9:23-25</a>
                <b> Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</b></p>
                <p> The message is clear, deny yourself everything and follow him. Jesus means, you take all your problems to him. The reality is, humans are the one solving their own problems.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+13%3A+22&version=NKJV"class = "verse" target="_blank">7.Matt 13: 22</a>
                <b>"The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful."</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Hebrews 13:5</a>
                <b>"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A3&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">8.Phil 2:3</a>
                <b>"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves."</b>
            </p>
                <p>In the above bible verses Jesus’s says beleivers should not love money and wealth and should give up on everything and follow him. But when we look at the reality we find that everyone loves money, everyone wishes to be wealthy. Nobody can abandon his family and friends for the sake of Jesus. The reality is everyone is ignoring Jesus. So why is this the case?Three things can explain this case.</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1.Jesus didn’t know what he was talking about</li>
                        <li>2.Jesus was lying</li>
                        <li>3.Gospels are mere fiction and God is imaginary</li>
                    </ol>
               </p>
               <h3>PART II</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A18+&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 5:18</a> The Bible says;
                <b>"For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."</b></p>
                <p>Jesus is very clear here, all the laws in the Old Testament still applies.
                </p>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+35%3A2&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Exodus 35:2</a>
                <b>"For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of Sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death."</b></p>
                <p> God lays down clear instructions. Nobody should work on the sabbath day, failure to which he/she shall  be killed. But looking at the reality,  all supermarkets have people working on sabbath. Recreational industry has people working on sabbath. Power plants, airlines, hospitals and emergency services all have people working on sabbath. Why are we not killing all those millions of people as God demands?</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut+21%3A18-21&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Deut 21:18-21.</a> The Bible says:
                <b>"If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town,this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid."</b></p>
                <p>Putting that verse in perspective, count all the youths that are stubborn and drunkard. God demands we stone millions of youths. But why are we not putting this law into practice? </p>
                <p><a href="Leviticus 20:10" class="verse" target="_blank">Leviticus 20:10</a>
                <b> “If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death."</b></p>
                <p> God is very clear that we are supposed to kill each and everyone who fornicate.The reality is we don’t kill people who fornicate.
                </p>
                <p>There are many other verses in the Bible that demands we stone millions of people including gays and lesbians. Remember also those laws to do with the clean and the unclean animals in the Old Testament. God sets rules on which animal to eat and not. But contrary hits you when you visit restaurants. For example Poke that is forbidden is being eaten by millions of people.
                </p>
               <p>As an intelligent person, when you put the above verses into perspective you should come to a conclusion that;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1.Considering the fact that no one practices what Jesus demands proof that God is imaginary.</li>
                    <li>2.Whoever wrote the Bible didn’t know that morality is fluid.It changes over time.Thats why we don’t practice all those laws given in the Bible.
                Laws should make sense, which is not the case with the laws from the bible.This contradiction leads to one thing,the Bible is just a book of myth.</li>
