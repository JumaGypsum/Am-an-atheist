                <p id="opening">The Bible is a holy book for many Christians.Most of them consider everything that is written in it as the truth.Millions of Christians claim that the creation story is literally true and that’s all we need to explain the origin of the universe and life in it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Science on the other hand has theories that explain the origin of the universe and life in a better way than the Bible.Taking the <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Big Bang</a> and <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Evolution</a> theories as an example,though they have their limitations,they are more plausible.As a result,we find the biblical explanation of the origin of the universe wrong.
                In this article,we’ll discuss why the Bible’s creation story is wrong.</p>
                <h3>GENESIS 1:</h3>
                <p><b>1.“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”</b>.God created the universe and earth at the same time.The fossil records show that the universe is approximately 13.8billion years and the earth is 4.6billion years old.That means if we rewind the clock,we find that earth is much younger than the entire universe <a href="">See this</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>2.”Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”</b>.The early universe wasn’t dark.As a result of the Big Bang,the universe was very bright.
                The earth didn’t have water in its early stages of formation.Neither did the universe.There was no rain either.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>3.”And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.”</b>Where did the light come from.I mean what was the source of the light?Light must have a source.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>4.”God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.”</b>Darkness is simply the absence of light.Darkness and light is a different quantity of the same thing(Photons).You cannot separate light from dark.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>5.”God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.”</b>-How did the evening and morning come about?God hasn’t made the sun yet.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>6.”And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”7.So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
                8.God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>9.And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.</b>-Water bodies on earth are not gathered at one place.We have inland lakes and oceans being in different places.Also earth didn’t have water in its early stages of formation.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>10.God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.11.Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 
                12.The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.13.And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
                </b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Plants need sunlight to grow and carry out photosynthesis.The sun had not been created yet.How did plants produce fruits without sunlight which is a basic ingredient of photosynthesis?
                The first living thing on earth wasn't a plant.It was single celled organisms which lived in the sea.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>14.And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years 15. and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
                16. God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
                </b></p>
                <br>
                <p>-The sun and the moon were not created at the same time.The sun is very old than the moon.
                The smaller light which is the moon doesn’t produce light.It reflects light from the sun.
                There are billions and billions of stars in the universe.And they are not in the earth’s atmosphere.Some of them are much larger than the earth.They cant fit in earth’s atmosphere.
                Also the sun is a star.
                Stars were the first ingredients of life in the universe.They were formed long before the earth came about.Not the other way round.<a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Learn more about stars</a></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>17.God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,18.to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
                19.And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
                </b></p>
                <p>-The Sun,moon and stars are not in earth’s atmosphere. <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">See this</a>
                The earth revolves around the Sun,not the other way round.
                Stars other than the Sun are not meant to give light on earth.They are very far away that is why we don’t see all of them.
                The sun is always there,it doesn’t govern the day.When its night time in one place its day time in another place.And the moon is not always there at night.The new moon is barely visible
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>20.”And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”21.So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good”
                22. God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”
                23.And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.”
                </b></p>
                <p>-Livestock didn’t exist before humans domesticated them.All animals were wild.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>26.Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”</b></p>
                <p>-Ruling over other animals is just a pure justification why human slaughter and kill animals.That’s a bad moral value</p>
                <br>
               <p><b>27.So God created mankind in his own image,in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</b></p>
               <p>-God never created Adam and Eve in this chapter.Also Man and woman were created at the same time.This is a contradiction with <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank"> Genesis chapter 2</a>.If God created man and woman,where did <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">hermaphrodite</a> come from?</p>
               <br>
                <p>At this point we realize that the Bible is wrong on creation in Genesis 1.When we analyze the writings,something should come in our mind.It was written by ancient people who were looking for a way to explain the origin of life and they barely understood science.Therefore God is not to be credited here.To learn more about the early  universe</p>
