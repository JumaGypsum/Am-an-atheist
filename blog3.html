                <p id="opening">If you are a Christian believer,you are aware of God's plan.Many believers attribute it to many difficulties that happen in their lives such as accidents,diseases etc.
                If you think about it,is God’s plan perfect?
                In this article I am going to assume you’re a believer and you’re probably popular with the statement “May his will be done”.Am going to show you that God's plan doesn’t make sense.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Psalms 139:16</a> the Bible says;<b>“Your eyes saw my unformed body;all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.” </b></p>
                <p>This verse implies that God knows everything that happens in everyone’s life.
                Putting the above verse into perspective,it means;</p>
                <p>-First of all each and avery abortion that has ever been done is part of Gods plan.God chose those children to die before they were born.Therefore the doctor who performed it and the mother who requested it done are blameless.They are just puppets fulfilling God’s will.This means believers who are fighting abortion are opposing Gods plan.</p>
                <br>
                <p>-Another example come from real life history.You've probably heard about Adolph Hitler.He was an evil incarnate.He killed millions of people.According to the above verse in the Bible,Hitler was part of God's plan.God created him in her mother’s womb knowing that he would turn out to be evil.Therefore millions of people who died in the holocaust deserved it.God chose them to die that way.Hitler is not to be blamed because he's just fulfilling God's plan.</p>
                <p>
                -Also think about prayers.If God has a divine plan,then why should you bother to pray in the first place?.What if what you’re praying for isn’t part of God's plan for your life?Do you think God will change his plan in favor of you?Of course not.We know God to be a prayer answering father.This contradicts what he’s supposed to be.Therefore even if those victims in the holocaust had to pray,they would still have died.</p>
                <p>-It's time you also think about Gods plan for you personally.If it happens you get hit by a car tomorrow or get your head chopped off,then that’s what was supposed to happen.Nobody should dare blame the driver of that car or that guy that chopped off your head.They should be cheered for fulfilling God’s plan on your life.</p>
                <p>-Also,say you get cancer and die in seven months time,that’s God's plan.Praying to cure cancer will be a waste of time.Anybody who prays to you is lying.</p>
                <p>-Think about rapist and murders.They are all blameless.If you get raped tomorrow and give birth,that's God's plan.He chose how that child was going to be conceived.We shouldn’t punish the rapist,Instead we should reward that rapist for doing their God planned duty.</p>
                <p>Having that in mind.Do you believe that murderers and rapists should go unpunished?Do you believe that Hitler was part of God's plan? Do you believe that God planned the death of millions of children through abortion?</p>
                <p>If you think about it as an intelligent Person you realize that Psalms 139:16 is meaningless. Why should the Bible contain such a vague verse?Because it’s not God's word. And God is Imaginary </p>
                <p>Things happen because they happen. Nothing is controlling events in our lives.No supernatural being has a plan for us.We humans mess up things.We also fix the same things.</p>
