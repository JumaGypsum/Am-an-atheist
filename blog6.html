                <p id="opening">Jesus is God and God never lies,he fulfills what he promises.At most all Christians will agree with this statement.Although many Christians consider this to be true,the statement holds one of the greatest lies ever told.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the Bible from the book of<a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John 14:12-14</a> the bible says;
                <b>”12.Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.”</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Jesus is clear, whoever believes in him will do the work he’s doing or even greater than that.He also adds that he will grant all believers wishes. Take your time to reason on what Jesus said. Can you show me any believer who has ever done what Jesus did? I mean are believers performing real miracles like Jesus did? Are believers  healing the sick? Is there any believer who has ever multiplied food like Jesus did? Is there any believer who has ever walked on water like Jesus? Is Jesus giving believers what they ask for in his name? These are just a few examples we can examine.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>When we look at the world we are living in,the reality that hits us is very different.We know for sure that;
                <ul>
                    <li>1.The number of believers who have ever done a real miracle and well documented is ZERO.Otherwise many believers would be nobel prize winners.</li>
                    <li>2.The number of believers who have ever healed the sick is ZERO.If there were true believers,people would not die when prayed for because Jesus would grant their wishes.</li>
                    <li>3.The number of believers who have ever prayed for food multiplication in the world is ZERO.Thats why children are starving to death.</li>
                    <li>4.The number of believers who have ever broken the laws of physics and walk on water is ZERO.</li>
                    <li>5.The number of times Jesus has ever answered prayers is ZERO.<a href="blog4.html" class="doc">Prove here</a></li>
                    <li>6.There is No single believer who has ever done greater things than Jesus.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Looking at the examples above,the outcome is Zero.This means that in the entire world there are no true believers.And if there was the results would be different.The world would be a paradise because Jesus would grant believers their wishes.Libraries and online platforms like Youtube ould be filled with documentaries on miracles performed by believers.People would not die when prayed for</p>
                <p>From those examples,if you’re an intelligent person,you should have realized something.
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Its only the Bible that contains miracles.Non has ever been performed in the real world.</li>
                    <li>2. People believe in Jesus but no one is a true believer.</li>
                    <li>3.Jesus never grants wishes of believers. And therefore he is a liar.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Since Jesus is God and God doesn’t lie and Jesus lied in John 14:12-14 means the Bible is wrong. And therefore God is imaginary.</p> <a href="#opening" class="navigation-link"><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a>
