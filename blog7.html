            <h2>TWO VERSES THAT PROVE THE LAST BOOK OF THE BIBLE IS WRONG.</h2>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="../img/false.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p id="opening"><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Revelation 6:12-13 </a>the Bible says;<b>12.I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Pondering the verses above starting with verse 12,an intelligent person should realize that verse is talking about the <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Lunar eclipse.</a>We know beyond doubt that this is an astronomical event and means nothing.Ancient people had no knowledge of what it was.That's why they attributed it to end times.Lunar eclipse happen again and again but that doesn’t mean it’s end times.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also think about verse 13.For anybody with knowledge of what <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">stars</a> are,they can’t fall on earth like the Bible claims.They are very gigantic in sizes with greater gravitational pull than planets.Stars are the basic components of solar systems with Mega gravity that keeps the planets and other objects revolving around them.For instance our sun is a star which hosts eight planets plus many other objects.Its size compared to earth,you can fit in 1.3Million earths.<a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">See this</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>There are very many stars in the universe and we can't observe all of them.Some are millions of <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Light years</a> away from us.There are stars that we will never see even with the most powerful telescopes because their light will never reach us in our lifetime.</p>
                <p>Having some knowledge about stars,we realize that it’s impossible for stars to fall to the earth.Considering the fact that our Sun only can swallow more than a million earths puts the Bible to shame with its knowledge.</p>
                <br>
                <P>The writers of the Bible knew stars to be just little lights in the skies as narrated In Genesis 1.They also never visualized how gigantic the universe is <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">See this</a>. They were never correct, and science has proved that.</p>
