                        <p id="opening">Many believers consider reading the Bible,being born again and having faith a direct ticket to heaven. Most of them beleieve that the Bible is literally true.But,they don’t realize that they are completely ignoring Jesus' core message.This article is going to prove to you that everyone is ignoring Jesus' core message.</p>    
                        <h3>PART I</h3>
                        <p>In the Bible, Jesus made a number of clear statements.
                        </p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NKJV"class = "verse" target="_blank">1.Mathew 6:19-21.</a> The Bible says;
                        <b>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."</b> 
                        </p>
                        <p>Jesus teaches us not to make riches here on earth. But what a contradiction we find in real life?Count how many pastors own personal Jets and expensive SUVs.Count how many politicians are wealthy and they still believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">2.Lule 14:33</a>The Bible says; 
                        <b>"Any of you who does not give up everything cannot be my disciple."</b></p>
                        <p>The message is clear.You should give up on EVERYTHING.Hate everyone and everything you love.Hate yourself too.Now look at reality and ask yourself how many people have done that!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A24&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">3.Matthew 6:24</a>The Bible says; 
                        <b>"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Money."</b></p>
                        <p>Jesus is so explicit here.No love for money.But look at our churches today.The offering is in terms of money.Every politician is after money.We are working because of money.Partners are cheating on each other because of money.Prostitution is a money oriented industry.Money runs the world.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A21-24&version=NKJV" class="verse"  target="_blank">4.Matthew 19:21-24</a>
                        Jesus answered, <b>"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</b>
                        </p> 
                        <p> Jesus wants you to sell everything and give to the poor.Your House,your clothes,your Tv,your car….. I mean everything.The reality is,no one has ever done that.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A28-29&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">5.Matthew 19:28-29</a>
                        <b>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</b></p>
                        <p>Here,Jesus wants you to abandon your family and friends for his sake.In reality no one has ever or is going to do this.Also this is a bad moral teaching.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A23-25&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">6.Luke 9:23-25</a>
                        <b>Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</b></p>
                        <p>The message is clear,deny yourself everything and follow him.Jesus means,you take all your problems to him.But the reality is,humans are the one solving their own problems.Jesus has no hand in this.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+13%3A+22&version=NKJV"class = "verse" target="_blank">7.Matt 13: 22</a>
                        <b>"The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful."</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Hebrews 13:5</a>
                        <b>"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A3&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">8.Phil 2:3</a>
                        <b>"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves."</b></p>
                        <p>In the above verses Jesus’s core message is,”Don't love money and wealth and Give up on everything”'.But when we look at the reality we find that everyone loves money,everyone is struggling to be wealthy.Every parent is happy when his children get rich.The school system is teaching us how to be rich.Nobody can ever abandon his family and friends for the sake of Jesus.The reality is everyone is ignoring Jesus.But why should this be the case?Is it that believers don’t read the Bible?Off course they do and they know about this.Therefore as an intelligent person,three things should be clear;</p>

                                <li>3.Gospels are mere fiction and God is imaginary</li>

                       <h3>PART II</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A18+&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 5:18</a>the Bible says;
                        <b>"For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."</b></p>
                        <p>Jesus is very clear here,All the laws in the Old Testament still applies.And Remember Jesus is God.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+35%3A2&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Exodus 35:2</a>
                        <b>"For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of Sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death."</b></p>
                        <p>God lays down clear instructions.Nobody should work on the sabbath day,failure to which he/she shall  be killed.But looking at the reality,all supermarkets have people working on sabbath.Recreational sector have people working on sabbath.Power plants,airlines,hospitals and emergency services all have people working on sabbath.Why are we not killing all those millions of people as God demands?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut+21%3A18-21&version=NKJV" class="verse" target="_blank">Deut 21:18-21.</a>The Bible says:
                        <b>"If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town,this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid."</b></p>
                        <p>Putting that verse in perspective,count all the Youths that are stubborn and drunkard.God demands we stone millions of youths.But why are we not putting this law into practice? </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="Leviticus 20:10" class="verse" target="_blank">Leviticus 20:10</a>
                        <b>“If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death."</b></p>
                        <p> God is very clear that we are supposed to kill each and everyone who fornicate.Am pretty sure almost everyone will get killed because fornication is the most practiced sin.But the reality is we don’t kill people who fornicate.Why?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are tones of other verses in the Bible that demands we stone millions of people including gays and lesbians.Remember also those laws to do with the clean and the unclean animals.God sets rules on which animal to eat and not.But contrary hits you when you visit Hotels in towns.For example Poke that is forbidden is being eaten by millions of people.
                        </p>
                       <p>As an intelligent person,when you put the above verses into perspective,you should come to a conclusion that;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1.Considering the fact that no one practices what Jesus demands proof that God is imaginary.</li>
                            <li>2.Whoever wrote the Bible didn’t know that morality is fluid.It changes over time.Thats why we don’t practice all those laws given in the Bible.
                        Laws should make sense, which is not the case with the laws from the bible.This contradiction leads to one thing,the Bible is just a book of myth.</li>

                    <h2>GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE</h2>
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="../img/imposible.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p id="opening"> According to the dictionary,God is defined as A being conceived to be perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe.Think of how the world would look if there was such a being! Is it possible for such a being to exist in the first place?let's exermine.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Someone by the name Epicures thought about it and came up with this interesting idea.
                        He said <b>“The gods can either take away evil from the world and will not, or, being willing to do so, cannot; or they neither can nor will, or lastly, they are both able and willing. If they have the will to remove evil and cannot, then they are not omnipotent. If they can, but will not, then they are not benevolent. If they are neither able nor willing, then they are neither omnipotent nor benevolent. Lastly, if they are both able and willing to annihilate evil, how does it exist?"</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Thinking about one of things this guy said.God has the power to remove evil in the society,but evil still exists,meaning he is not all caring.This contradicts his nature.It also puts limits to his powers too.</p>
                        <p>Onother way of aproaching the same idea is toput God's powers to test.We ask this question,"Can God create a stone larger and so heavy that he cant lift?If the answer is Yes then God's power is limited.Still if the answer is No his powers are still limited.This contradicts his nature.Therfore he cant exist.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another example comes from the Bible in the book of <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7.</a>Jesus says;
                        <b> "Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”</b></p>
                        <p> Now think about what Jesus said as an intelligent person.Does this promise get fulfilled in our daily lives?Assume you’re a child.You pray to God for food since you’re almost starving to death.What would you expect to happen according to Jesus's statement?Your expectations are,an all loving,all caring God to get the food delivered to you.In fact a child doesn’t have to pray.A good caring parent knows when his child needs food.
                        But strangely we find that millions of people are dying of starvation every year.And that tells us how non existing God is.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another impossibility comes from the fact that God is omniscient.This means that God knows all that will happen in your life until you die.Ask yourself,do you have a free will in such a world?Of course not.
                        <a href="" class="" target="_blank">Psalm 139:16</a> The Bible says,<b> "You saw me before I was born and scheduled each day of my life before I began to breathe. Every day was recorded in your book!"</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>          
                        This verse Invalidates who God is in a great way.Let's look at history.We all know that  Hitler was very evil.He killed millions of people in the holocaust.Now think about it.God created Hitler knowing very well that he will end up murdering millions of people.That sounds crazy right?
                        Also God knows whether you will go to heaven or hell.Creating someone knowing he will end up in hell is so evil.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another way to approach this is to look at how God is defined.He is the ruler and originator of the universe.Why does the universe need an originator/creator? Because, according to religious logic, the universe cannot exist unless it has a creator. A believer will say, "nothing can exist unless it is created." However, that statement immediately constructs a contradiction, because we must then wonder who created God. For a believer the answer to that is simple."God is the one thing that does not need a creator. God is timeless and has always existed." How can it be that everything MUST have a creator, while God must Not?The contradiction should be suggesting something.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>  As soon as you think about the concept of a perfect, omnipotent, omniscient being, you realize the impossibility of the concept. That impossibility is yet another way to see that God is imaginary.</p>

                        <p id="opening">If you are a Christian believer,you are aware of God's plan.Many believers attribute it to many difficulties that happen in their lives such as accidents,diseases etc.
                        If you think about it,is God’s plan perfect?
                        In this article I am going to assume you’re a believer and you’re probably popular with the statement “May his will be done”.Am going to show you that God's plan doesn’t make sense.</p>

                        Putting the above verse into perspective,it means;</p>
                        <p>-First of all each and avery abortion that has ever been done is part of Gods plan.God chose those children to die before they were born.Therefore the doctor who performed it and the mother who requested it done are blameless.They are just puppets fulfilling God’s will.This means believers who are fighting abortion are opposing Gods plan.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>-Another example come from real life history.You've probably heard about Adolph Hitler.He was an evil incarnate.He killed millions of people.According to the above verse in the Bible,Hitler was part of God's plan.God created him in her mother’s womb knowing that he would turn out to be evil.Therefore millions of people who died in the holocaust deserved it.God chose them to die that way.Hitler is not to be blamed because he's just fulfilling God's plan.</p>
                        <p>
                        -Also think about prayers.If God has a divine plan,then why should you bother to pray in the first place?.What if what you’re praying for isn’t part of God's plan for your life?Do you think God will change his plan in favor of you?Of course not.We know God to be a prayer answering father.This contradicts what he’s supposed to be.Therefore even if those victims in the holocaust had to pray,they would still have died.</p>
                        <p>-It's time you also think about Gods plan for you personally.If it happens you get hit by a car tomorrow or get your head chopped off,then that’s what was supposed to happen.Nobody should dare blame the driver of that car or that guy that chopped off your head.They should be cheered for fulfilling God’s plan on your life.</p>
                        <p>-Also,say you get cancer and die in seven months time,that’s God's plan.Praying to cure cancer will be a waste of time.Anybody who prays to you is lying.</p>
                        <p>-Think about rapist and murders.They are all blameless.If you get raped tomorrow and give birth,that's God's plan.He chose how that child was going to be conceived.We shouldn’t punish the rapist,Instead we should reward that rapist for doing their God planned duty.</p>
                        <p>Having that in mind.Do you believe that murderers and rapists should go unpunished?Do you believe that Hitler was part of God's plan? Do you believe that God planned the death of millions of children through abortion?</p>
                        <p>If you think about it as an intelligent Person you realize that Psalms 139:16 is meaningless. Why should the Bible contain such a vague verse?Because it’s not God's word. And God is Imaginary </p>
                        <p>Things happen because they happen. Nothing is controlling events in our lives.No supernatural being has a plan for us.We humans mess up things.We also fix the same things.</p>

                        <p id="opening">Many believers agree that through prayers,many problems get solved.That whenever you pray God listens and answers your prayers.But the reality is believing in prayers is a pure superstition.Prayers have never fixed anything.How do we know that prayers don’t work?Well, we analyze what Jesus said in the Bible.We’ll also cite other examples out of the Bible.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Imagine you are a believer,you have faith in God and you’re sure God always answers your prayers.You kneel down and say this simple prayer.
                        <b>“Dear God, almighty, all-powerful, all-loving creator of the universe, I pray to you to cure every case of cancer on this planet tonight. I pray in faith, knowing you will bless me as you describe in <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Matthew 17:20</a>, <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 21:21</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Mark 11:24</a>, <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John 14:12-14</a>, <a href="" class="verse">Matthew 18:19</a>and <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">James 5:15-16</a>. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen."</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is a simple,non materialistic,unselfish prayer that you pray knowing that when it gets answered,it will help millions of people in remarkable ways.In fact it will turn most skeptics into believers.Now what do you think it’s going to happen.Is cancer going to be cured by tomorrow?Of course not.</p>
                        <p>When we analyze Jesus statements in the Bible,he promises a dozens of possibilities.Let's look at the following verses from the Bible.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 7:7</a>Jesus says:
                        <b> “Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 17:20</a>Jesus says:<b></b>“For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.”</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 21:21:</a><b>“I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Mark 11:24:</a><b>“Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John chapter14:12-14 </a>Jesus tells us just how easy prayer can be:<b>"I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">James 5:15-16</a>the Bible says:<b>“And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Having read what Jesus said in the Bible,does He fulfill what  he promises?Jesus says nothing will be impossible to us through prayers.He says that anyone who asks in his name shall receive.But why is it that we have so many impossibilities?Why is it that if we pray for cancer to get cured nothing happens?Or does Jesus give a boundary on what we should pray about?.Why is it that sick people who get prayed to die?Why is it that innocent children starve to death in many places in the world.All these impossibilities contradict what Jesus says and what he’s supposed to be.</p>  
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Matthew 18:19</a>Jesus says:<b>“Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” </b></p>
                        <p>Do you think that cancer will be cured,if we gather a million believers and ask them to pray in the name of Jesus?No,of course no.Nothing will happen.This contradicts what Jesus said in the Bible.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Psalms 139:16</a>The Bible says;<b>“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If God knows what will happen in your life time then why bother to pray in the first place?You don’t have free will. Nothing is going to change God's plan about you.Why should you pray for cancer when God knew it’s the same disease that is going to kill you.Jesus promising to fulfill what we pray for and he doesn’t,means he is a lier.</p>
                        <p>If you are an intelligent person,you should have noticed something from this contradictions
                        <ol>
                            <li>1. Jesus is a liar.</li>
                            <li>2. Jesus never knew what he was talking about.</li>
                            <li>3. God does exist, but he never answers prayers. Unfortunately, God is defined by the Bible to be a prayer-answering being. The contradiction between the reality of God and the definition of God proves that God is imaginary.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We can draw other examples from our history.A scientific experiment was done in an attempt to discover whether prayers had any effect. <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Visit the article here</a>
                        In this study,researchers found that having people pray for heart bypass surgery patients had no effect on their recovery. In fact, patients who knew they were being prayed for had a slightly higher rate of complications.Even theologians and religious leaders agreed on the same as seen in this <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">article</a></p>
                        <p>Despite all this tangible evidence alot of believers come up with rationalizations to defend their beliefs.You may hear some of them say that God is not tested through scientific experiments.Or God must remain hidden.
                        If God must remain hidden then he must not answer prayers because he will be exposed.Also from the Bible God is not hidden.
                        Also when Jesus makes direct statements like “nothing will be impossible” and doesn’t mean what he says.It just proves how imaginary he is.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another section of believers may say that prayers are answered in the form of “YES,NO,WAIT ''.This is not the truth because,No matter what you pray to the answer is always “YES,NO,WAIT.
                        Whether it’s God,The sun or any other thing.
                        To know that the answer is always Yes,No and Wait no matter who you pray to,let’s examine this example.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I would like you to do this simple experiment.Take out your phone and ask it to give you five thousand shillings at the end of the week.Since you are a believer and you trust in Jesus,ask the same.Now wait till the end of the week.If you are an intelligent observer,you’ll realize that both prayers get answered at the same rate.When the two weeks end you may or you may not get the five thousand shillings in both scenarios.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Another simple example.Lets say your a group of 30 people on a road trip.All of you have read the Bible in <a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Luke 1:37</a>.Then an accident occurs.All your colleagues die except you.When reporters come to interview you,we here you say something like “Am very lucky,if it was not God, I wouldn’t be here I would be dead.I prayed to him and he answered my prayers”.
                        Take a moment and ask yourself how special are you that God decided to answer your prayers and assumed the rest of your colleagues?What do you think the families of the deceased would think about your God when they hear you make such statements?Selfish right? The conclusion is,your prayers were never answered.And if you thank God that you didn’t die but the rest of your colleagues died,God is to be blamed.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Also;
                        When you pray, work hard and pass exams and thank God,God is to be blamed for your colleague who prayed, worked hard and failed.
                        When you pray for food that is on your dining table.God is to be blamed for those innocent children who are starving in the rest of the world.
                        When you rejoice that God has answered your prayers by healing you.Then God is to be blamed for that person who prayed and died due to sickness.etc</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Our Kenyan National anthem is like a prayer.It’s recited in schools every week.Our religious leader holds prayer meetings to pray for our nation.But at the end nothing changes.Poverty is still a thing.Hunger is still there.Corruption is never ending.Fornication is the language and rape is still there.Terrorism is still there.Accidents etc</p>
                        <p>Recently,many people lost lives through accidents at a place known as Salgaa.A prayer was done to protect more deaths.But it didn't fix anything.Its the engineers who solved the problem.Its a scientific method that worked.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s time to realize that prayers have zero effect on our lives.Each and every answered prayer is just a coincidence.
                        <ul>
                            <li>* No matter what you pray for.No matter who is praying,</li>
                            <li>* No matter which God you’re praying to</li>
                            <li>* Don't deny yourself food  because you’re fasting.nothing is going to change.Just look for some other means to solve those problems.</li>
                            <li>* Don't deny your family medication,prayers never heal.Its the medicine that heals you.</li>
                            <li>* Don't rebuke people when they don't pray before they eat,it's their effort that made it possible to put that food on the table.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p id="opening">The Bible is a holy book for many Christians.Most of them consider everything that is written in it as the truth.Millions of Christians claim that the creation story is literally true and that’s all we need to explain the origin of the universe and life in it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Science on the other hand has theories that explain the origin of the universe and life in a better way than the Bible.Taking the <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Big Bang</a> and <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Evolution</a> theories as an example,though they have their limitations,they are more plausible.As a result,we find the biblical explanation of the origin of the universe wrong.
                        In this article,we’ll discuss why the Bible’s creation story is wrong.</p>
                        <h3>GENESIS 1:</h3>
                        <p><b>1.“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”</b>.God created the universe and earth at the same time.The fossil records show that the universe is approximately 13.8billion years and the earth is 4.6billion years old.That means if we rewind the clock,we find that earth is much younger than the entire universe <a href="">See this</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>2.”Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”</b>.The early universe wasn’t dark.As a result of the Big Bang,the universe was very bright.
                        The earth didn’t have water in its early stages of formation.Neither did the universe.There was no rain either.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>3.”And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.”</b>Where did the light come from.I mean what was the source of the light?Light must have a source.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>4.”God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.”</b>Darkness is simply the absence of light.Darkness and light is a different quantity of the same thing(Photons).You cannot separate light from dark.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>5.”God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.”</b>-How did the evening and morning come about?God hasn’t made the sun yet.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>6.”And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”7.So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
                        8.God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>9.And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.</b>-Water bodies on earth are not gathered at one place.We have inland lakes and oceans being in different places.Also earth didn’t have water in its early stages of formation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>10.God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.11.Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 
                        12.The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.13.And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
                        </b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Plants need sunlight to grow and carry out photosynthesis.The sun had not been created yet.How did plants produce fruits without sunlight which is a basic ingredient of photosynthesis?
                        The first living thing on earth wasn't a plant.It was single celled organisms which lived in the sea.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>14.And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years 15. and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.
                        16. God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
                        </b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>-The sun and the moon were not created at the same time.The sun is very old than the moon.
                        The smaller light which is the moon doesn’t produce light.It reflects light from the sun.
                        There are billions and billions of stars in the universe.And they are not in the earth’s atmosphere.Some of them are much larger than the earth.They cant fit in earth’s atmosphere.
                        Also the sun is a star.

                        The earth revolves around the Sun,not the other way round.
                        Stars other than the Sun are not meant to give light on earth.They are very far away that is why we don’t see all of them.
                        The sun is always there,it doesn’t govern the day.When its night time in one place its day time in another place.And the moon is not always there at night.The new moon is barely visible

                        <p id="opening">Jesus is God and God never lies,he fulfills what he promises.At most all Christians will agree with this statement.Although many Christians consider this to be true,the statement holds one of the greatest lies ever told.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the Bible from the book of<a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">John 14:12-14</a> the bible says;
                        <b>”12.Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.”</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Jesus is clear, whoever believes in him will do the work he’s doing or even greater than that.He also adds that he will grant all believers wishes. Take your time to reason on what Jesus said. Can you show me any believer who has ever done what Jesus did? I mean are believers performing real miracles like Jesus did? Are believers  healing the sick? Is there any believer who has ever multiplied food like Jesus did? Is there any believer who has ever walked on water like Jesus? Is Jesus giving believers what they ask for in his name? These are just a few examples we can examine.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When we look at the world we are living in,the reality that hits us is very different.We know for sure that;
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.The number of believers who have ever done a real miracle and well documented is ZERO.Otherwise many believers would be nobel prize winners.</li>
                            <li>2.The number of believers who have ever healed the sick is ZERO.If there were true believers,people would not die when prayed for because Jesus would grant their wishes.</li>
                            <li>3.The number of believers who have ever prayed for food multiplication in the world is ZERO.Thats why children are starving to death.</li>
                            <li>4.The number of believers who have ever broken the laws of physics and walk on water is ZERO.</li>
                            <li>5.The number of times Jesus has ever answered prayers is ZERO.<a href="blog4.html" class="doc">Prove here</a></li>
                            <li>6.There is No single believer who has ever done greater things than Jesus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Looking at the examples above,the outcome is Zero.This means that in the entire world there are no true believers.And if there was the results would be different.The world would be a paradise because Jesus would grant believers their wishes.Libraries and online platforms like Youtube ould be filled with documentaries on miracles performed by believers.People would not die when prayed for</p>
                        <p>From those examples,if you’re an intelligent person,you should have realized something.
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Its only the Bible that contains miracles.Non has ever been performed in the real world.</li>
                            <li>2. People believe in Jesus but no one is a true believer.</li>
                            <li>3.Jesus never grants wishes of believers. And therefore he is a liar.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Since Jesus is God and God doesn’t lie and Jesus lied in John 14:12-14 means the Bible is wrong. And therefore God is imaginary.</p> <a href="#opening" class="navigation-link"><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a>

                    <h2>TWO VERSES THAT PROVE THE LAST BOOK OF THE BIBLE IS WRONG.</h2>

                        <p id="opening"><a href="" class="verse" target="_blank">Revelation 6:12-13 </a>the Bible says;<b>12.I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Pondering the verses above starting with verse 12,an intelligent person should realize that verse is talking about the <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Lunar eclipse.</a>We know beyond doubt that this is an astronomical event and means nothing.Ancient people had no knowledge of what it was.That's why they attributed it to end times.Lunar eclipse happen again and again but that doesn’t mean it’s end times.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Also think about verse 13.For anybody with knowledge of what <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">stars</a> are,they can’t fall on earth like the Bible claims.They are very gigantic in sizes with greater gravitational pull than planets.Stars are the basic components of solar systems with Mega gravity that keeps the planets and other objects revolving around them.For instance our sun is a star which hosts eight planets plus many other objects.Its size compared to earth,you can fit in 1.3Million earths.<a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">See this</a></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are very many stars in the universe and we can't observe all of them.Some are millions of <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">Light years</a> away from us.There are stars that we will never see even with the most powerful telescopes because their light will never reach us in our lifetime.</p>
                        <p>Having some knowledge about stars,we realize that it’s impossible for stars to fall to the earth.Considering the fact that our Sun only can swallow more than a million earths puts the Bible to shame with its knowledge.</p>
                        <br>
                        <P>The writers of the Bible knew stars to be just little lights in the skies as narrated In Genesis 1.They also never visualized how gigantic the universe is <a href="" class="doc" target="_blank">See this</a>. They were never correct, and science has proved that.</p>
