                <p>According to the dictionary,God is defined as A being conceived to be perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe.Think of how the world would look if there was such a being! Is it possible for such a being to exist in the first place?let's exermine.</p>

                <img src="../img/plan.jpg">
                <p>If you are a Christian believer,you are aware of God's plan.Many believers attribute it to many difficulties that happen in their lives such as accidents,diseases etc.
                If you think about it,is God’s plan perfect?
                In this article I am going to assume you’re a believer and you’re probably popular with the statement “May his will be done”.Am going to show you that God's plan doesn’t make sense.</p>

                <p><p>Many believers agree that through prayers,many problems get solved.That whenever you pray God listens and answers your prayers.But the reality is believing in prayers is a pure superstition.Prayers have never fixed anything.How do we know that prayers don’t work?Well, we analyze what Jesus said in the Bible.We’ll also cite other examples out of the Bible.</p></p>

                <img src="../img/creation2.jpg">
                <p>The Bible is a holy book for many Christians.Most of them consider everything that is written in it as the truth.Millions of Christians claim that the creation story is literally true and that’s all we need to explain the origin of the universe and life in it.</p>

                <p>Jesus is God and God never lies,he fulfills what he promises.At most all Christians will agree with this statement.Although many Christians consider this to be true,the statement holds one of the greatest lies ever told.</p>

                <p>Tell me that the Bible is Good at science and I’ll cite many verses that prove it is scientifically accurate just like the people of its time.In this article were proving that the writers of the Bible screwed everything up to the last book.Lets pick a random verse.</p>
